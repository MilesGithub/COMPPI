Description: Accession numbers deleted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
Name:        delac_sp.txt
Release:     2013_03 of 06-Mar-2013

This file lists the accession numbers of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries
which have been deleted from the database.

Deleted entries are almost exclusively Open Reading Frames (ORFs) that
have been wrongly predicted to code for proteins. When there is enough
evidence that  these  hypothetical  proteins  are not real we take the
decision to remove them from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

Also see the file delac_tr.txt for the list of accession numbers which
have been deleted in UniProtKB/TrEMBL.
