Description: List of accession numbers deleted from UniProtKB/TrEMBL
Name:        DELAC_TR.TXT
Release:     2013_03 of 06-Mar-2013

This file lists the accession numbers of UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries which have
been deleted from the database. Most deletions are due to the deletion of
the corresponding CDS in the source nucleotide sequence databases EMBL-
Bank/DDBJ/GenBank. In addition, some entries are recognised to be Open
Reading frames (ORFs) that have been wrongly predicted to code for
proteins. When there is enough evidence that these hypothetical proteins
are not real, we take the decision to remove them from UniProtKB/TrEMBL.

Also see the file DELAC_SP.TXT for the list of accession numbers which
have been deleted in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
