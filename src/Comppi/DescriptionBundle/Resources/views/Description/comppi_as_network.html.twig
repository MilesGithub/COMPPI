	<h1><ul class="NavMenu"><li><a href="{{ path('ComppiDescriptionBundle_help') }}">Help</a></li><li>ComPPI for Network Scientists</li></ul></h1>
	
	<br /><p>ComPPI is a multicomponent, undirected, weighted protein-protein interaction network.
	<ul>
		<li>Nodes: proteins</li>
		<li>Edges: undirected edges representing any relationship between two proteins</li>
		<li>Edge weights: interaction scores</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<h2>Node attributes</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Name: the protein name in the strongest available naming convention, usually UniProt/Swiss-prot</li>
		<li>Naming convention: the naming convention of the name</li>
		<li>Synonyms: other names of the protein</li>
		<li>Taxonomy ID: the GO Taxonomy ID of the related species, such as '9606'</li>
		<li>Localization scores: the probability that the protein belongs to a given major localization</li>
		<li>Major localizations: cytoplasm, nucleus, etc.</li>
		<li>Minor localizations: the GO subcellular component IDs</li>
		<li>Localization PubMed IDs: the PubMed IDs of the publications describing the source databases or the specific publication which relates the protein to a given localization</li>
		<li>Localization source databases: the names of the source databases of the localization data</li>
		<li>Localization experimental systems: the experimental system that associated the protein with a given localization (such as 'annotated protein expression')</li>
		<li>Localization experimental system type: Unknown (0), experimental (1), predicted (2)</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<h2>Edge attributes</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Interaction score: the probability of the given interaction, can be thought of as edge weight</li>
		<li>Source databases: the names of the databases that describe the interaction</li>
		<li>Source PubMed IDs: the PubMed IDs of the publications describing the source databases or the specific publication which describes the interaction</li>
		<li>Experimental systems: the experimental system that determined the interaction (such as 'yeast two-hybrid')</li>
		<li>Experimental system type: Unknown (0), experimental (1), predicted (2)</li>
	</ul></p>
	
	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<p>The custom downloads contain various combinations of these, please refer to the <a href="{{ path('ComppiDescriptionBundle_help') }}/downloads">relevant help section</a> for further details.</p>
	
	<p>The nodes are identified by ComPPI IDs in the downloadable full database (SQL). These IDs are not stable, they may change in every release. If you use ComPPI to build a network, you may want to consider using the protein names as node IDs, otherwise networks of different ComPPI versions may not be compatible with each other.</p>
